	<h2>Photography</h2>
	<h3>Outdoor photography and photo editing is always something that I have been interested in and have done a little bit of. At a wedding that I attended in Mexico, I was in charge of taking some candid photos and taking photos of the location. I have also taken photos for friends and family. The following photos are just a few that I have taken and edited.</h3>

	<h2>Sports</h2>
	
	<h3>I have been playing sports since I was 8 years old. I started out with basketball and softball and then eventually found my love for volleyball in middle school. When it came to college, I decided to give up basketball and continue with volleyball and softball at a junior college in Rockford, IL.  </h3>
